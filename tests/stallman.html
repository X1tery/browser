      The views expressed here are my personal views, not those of
      the <a href="http://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</a> or

      For the sake of separation, this site has always been

    <p>
      I am thinking of making another trip to Europe during February - April.
      If you would like to invite me to speak during that trip, please write
      to me at rms-invitation@gnu.org with "feb-apr" as the subject.

    <p>
      If you want to send me GPG-encrypted mail, do not trust key
      servers!
      Some of them have phony keys under my name and email address,
      made by someone else as a trick.
      See <a href="/gpg.html">gpg.html</a> for my real key.
    </p>

    <p>
      Richard Stallman has cancer.  Fortunately it is slow-growing and
      manageable follicular lymphoma.  Treatment put it into
      remission, and he can expect to live many more years.  However,
      he now has to be even more careful not to catch Covid-19.

This file is ~/public_html/common/urgent_action.html alias ~/urgent.html

This file is for inserting select polnotes from the batch you are inserting
into current.html.  Notes from RMS that had    Urgent    in the subject,
polnotes having Urgent:  in their titles, spend seven days here.

To all such notes RMS asks us kindly to add the snippet
before posting it, if you have time to fit that step in.
There is a snippet to occasion each type of urgent note:
petitions, forms, letters, White House, Congress, States,
etc.  Add the snippet that matches the text of the note.

See: 
~/snippets
~/HOWTO/post-a-polnote
~/HOWTO/workflow.cpiral

To insert urgent polnotes manually, 
you replace the title line with an expiry-date line.

     <!--  

Insructions in a nutshell:

Only 4 list items are wanted here.  If you add a new list item to the top of
this file, then please *move* the oldest list item at the bottom over to:

    ~/public_html/there-ought-to-be-a-law.html 

Thanks.

Here is the detailed version.

The list items in this file are presented on the main page of stallman.org,
/index.html.  So it shouldn't take up too much page space.  Four texts is the
current desired limit. 

New texts should be added to this file at the top of the list 
as new list items with an id attribute of your choosing.

Old list items should then be subtracted from the bottom of this list, and moved
from here to the top of the list in /there-ought-to-be-a-law.html.  

No info is lost. The stallman.org URL 

    /there-ought-to-be-a-law.html

links to the whole version, the master list of laws that ought to be.  It
renders the entire list because it is set up to transclude the list items in
this file:

    /common/ought-to-be-a-law.html
    
putting the items in this file at the top.

The front page offers the link text "More items where there ought to be a law".
This takes you to the whole version. When viewed in your text editor, then:

    /common/ought-to-be-a-law  (this primary receiving file, the head file)
    /there-ought-to-be-a-law   (the secondary receiving file, body file)

in newest-first order.

      *   Abandoned coalmines and oil and gas wells are now one of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/07/abandoned-infrastructure-one-of-the-biggest-polluters-in-the-world-report">biggest sources</a>
      of the powerful greenhouse gas methane, new data shows, and
      little effort is being made to clean them up.*
    </p>
    <p>
      I expect that the fossil fuel companies to divest themselves from old
      mines and wells in ways that will avoid liability for them &mdash; just as
      they sometimes <a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2015-sep-dec.html#8_October_2015_(Patriot_Coal)">disconnect themselves from responsibility</a> for
      supporting former workers.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I suggest making it a felony to implement a restructuring of
      business or assets in a way that is likely to result predictably in
      strand assets that carry financial responsibilities with no one
      capable of shouldering the responsibilities.

  <li id="Require Services to be available anonymously">
    <p>
      A pitifully weak attempt to solve a real problem: asking for a federal
law that would permit victims of domestic abuse and stalking to <a href="https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/data-brokers-harm-abuse-survivors-we-need-a-law-to-stop-them">demand
    that data brokers delete information about them</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
Data, once collected, <em>will</em> be abused.  The way to prevent that abuse is to
facilitate refusing to hand it over in the first place.
    </p>
    <p>
Here is my proposal for protecting the specific people known to be in
particular danger, and everyone else who could be harmed if
individuals, businesses or governments use their personal data
against them without a search warrant: require services to be available
anonymously.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li id="toxic-chemicals">
    The regulation of toxic chemicals in the US is hamstrung by laws that
    enable companies to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/17/lawsuit-prevent-hiding-toxic-chemicals">keep their use and their presence in any place
      secret</a>.
    <p>
      The selfish interest of those who keep trade secrets is rational but
      antisocial.  In many cases the only harm it does is to hold back the
      general advance of technology.  But sometimes it does really nasty
      things.  For digital hardware and software, it often gives companies a
      way to subjugate their users.  Regarding use of toxic chemicals, it
      endangers public health.
    <p>
      Why would legislators pass laws to "protect" companies instead of
      protecting the people they harm?  I suspect it is partly because these
      companies are influential and the legislators seek their support,
      and partly because the legislators ask them for campaign funds.
    <p>
      But it is also partly the result of the mindset of "trickle down", which
      assumes that the only way to get more funds for the state is to
      let increase the size of the economy by letting companies have what
      they want.  Unfortunately, what they want is often to be allowed to
      harm the public.
    <p>
      Most Democrats in Congress got corrupted this way in the 80s and 90s.
      (The exceptions are the progressive Democrats.)  Now in the UK
      Starmer is guiding Labour into that sort of corruption.
    <p>
      Clearly our laws should say that any public need to know about the
      presence of toxic substances in a business facility overrides the
      desire to keep them secret.
  </li>

  <li id="state-business-funding">
    *China-owned British Steel said to have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/23/china-owned-british-steel-requested-600m-taxpayer-support">requested &pound;600m of taxpayer
      support</a>.*
    <p>
      Whether the owners are Chinese is a question that there is no need to
      ask, because the state should <em>never</em> give money to a business "to
      support it."
      Instead it should offer to lend money to the company for suitable
      repayment, or else buy equity at a fair price.
    <p>
      These two ways of supporting a company avoid giving the owners an
      opporunity to rip off the state -- which the company's owners are likely
      to try to do, if they can, regardless of which country they are from.
    <p>
      With a policy like this, it wouldn't matter which country the
      company's owners are from.

It was not, as I thought, Venezuelan.  It identified itself falsely as
registered in Guyana.  I did not see in the article where, if anywhere,
the ship was actually registered.  Maybe I was mistaken in saying that
seizing the ship was an act of war against Venezuela, or any country.

<h3>UK airports</h3>
<p> I'm looking for people who would
    like to launch and run a petition where people will publicly
    state that if the UK starts fingerprinting air travelers,
    they will not fly out of UK airports.  The site should
    display the names and cities of signers.  Please write to rms
    at gnu.org if you are interested.

<h3>No national identity cards</h3>
<p>
I'd like to make a list of countries that do not require a national
identity card, and have no plans to adopt one. If you live in or have
confirmed knowledge of such a country, please send email to rms at
gnu.org.

<p>
Here's my list of countries with no national ID cards
and no plans for one: Australia, Canada, New Zealand, UK.
Australia's previous government tried to
institute national ID cards, but the Labor government dropped
the plan.</p>

<p>India has mostly finished imposing a national biometric ID number
in a grand act of oppression.
</p>

<p>Switzerland has national ID cards which are optional,
but they or some other government ID card are needed for some purposes.
<p>
Iceland doesn't have ID cards as such, but they
have ID numbers that citizens are forced to use frequently.
For example, the national ID number is often required to
rent a video or use a gym.
</p>

<p>
Denmark issues non-photo ID cards with a "person number", and many
services use this card to identify people.
</p>

<p>
Norway will impose a national
<a href="http://people.skolelinux.org/pere/blog/Norwegian_citizens_now_required_by_law_to_give_their_fingerprint_to_the_police.html">biometric
ID card</a>.
</p>

<h3>The Lifelong Activist</h3>
<p>
People often ask how I manage to continue devoting myself to
progressive activism (such as the free software movement) for
years without burning out.  The best way I can answer is by
recommending a book, <a href="https://hillaryrettigproductivity.com/the-lifelong-activist/">
The Lifelong Activist</a> by Hillary Rettig.

<p>I disagree with the book on one theoretical point in the last
part of the book: we shouldn't think of political activism as
<em>being</em> marketing and sales, because those terms refer to
business, and politics is something much more
important than mere business.  However, this doesn't diminish
the value of the book's practical advice about borrowing
techniques from marketing and sales.</p>
